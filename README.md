# TCNJ_Sign_In_App

This project is a Sign-in mobile applicaton on the Android platform for the Computer Science Department at The College of New Jersey
Instead of signing in Visitors through paper, which increases risk of bad handwriting, the sign-in app will allow Visitor name,
email, and phone number to be stored on the app's personal SQLite database, with a tablet being used.  Future work includes possible Google map integration
to see where potential students are coming from and creating a central database where the app can be used concurrently on multiple
tablets.  At this point in time, the user interface is simple and should be enhanced for future work.
